# Ratatat
A clone of the Patatap app, built as part of the Web Developer Bootcamp course.

Ratatat creates graphics with [Paper.js](http://paperjs.org/) and sounds with [Howler.js](http://howlerjs.com/)

**Instructions:** Hit any of the letter keys on your keyboard to generate a sound and graphic effect. It's more fun than it sounds!
